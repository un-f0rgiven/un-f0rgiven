### Hi! My name is Alexander Naymushin.

I live in Vladivostok.

In 2007, I graduated from the University with a degree in manager of state and municipal administration.  
From 2007 to 2017, I worked in the supply sector at the food production of Wimm-Bill-Dann (later PepsiCo) and in the procurement of the regional retail network of mobile and digital equipment "SemSot".  
From 2017 to 2023 I worked for the company [DNS](https://www.dns-shop.ru/about ) - one of the leaders of the Russian market for the sale of digital and household appliances. In 6 years, I has worked my way up from a line employee to the head of a line in the commercial department.  
During my work, I realized that analytics, process automation and work optimization are of the greatest interest to me. This prompted me to move into the field of programming.  
Having studied the market of educational platforms, I chose [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io ), where I took a course in the Python developer program.  
I strive to be useful to society by applying my knowledge and skills, and I am ready to develop in programming through practical participation in projects.
